Scaler
======
Scaler is a practice tool for musicians! It keeps track of all the keys you're practicing (which you should probably be practicing in multiple different ways, like scales, arpeggios, etc), but right now expects you to remember what things you want to practice in each key. But it does keep track of the tempo you shoul be practicing at, and ramps it up gradually according to parameters you set.

If you're a lazy practicer like me, it also gives an input for you to enter how many keys you want to practice each day and only prompts you to do that many keys. The counter resets at midnight local (I think, I should write a test or something).

Demo

I'm a rubbish explainer, so take a look at the demo at http://scaler-demo.herokuapp.com/

Tests
=====
Yeah, the tests are left over from angular-seed and don't work. I Write Sins, Not Tests. So, er, hopefully no one will actually read the code. I'll write 'em one of these days, probably _not_.

Bugs and suggestions
====================
Open issues! Label 'em 'enhancements' for suggestions and 'bug' for bugs! Easy!
